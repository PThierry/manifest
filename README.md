# About the WooKey project manifests hierarchy

The WooKey project hierarchy is separated into two main components:

   * Software components
   * Hardware components


The software components manifests are stored in the soft/ directory.
They permit to download the overall SDK for the various WooKey targets
(i.e. firmware profiles, on a given board).

The hardware components manifests are stored in the hard/ directory.
They permit to download the hardware designs.
